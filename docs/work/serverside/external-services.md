        > This service will be used by our app to keep track of our user-base. Furthermore, it will allow us to outsource some management of user info to Google.
        Essentially, we will be relying on Google for storing data associated to our users. 
        Without sign-in and authentication through Google services the PicMe Gallery will not be functional. We want to maintain some level of security and credibility over our user-base, while letting Google do the heavy-lifting.
