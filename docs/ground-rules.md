# Ground Rules

* What are the core practices you will use to coordinate your work as a team?
>The members of PicMe Gallery's team will check in every day via Zoom around 6:30 P.M. (We can change the time, just communicate via Slack between the class breaks.)
During a check-in we'll decide on tasks to complete and who will complete what tasks.
It is required to send the other team member's a message to update each otherâ€™s progress by 8:30 P.M. every night on Slack.
Ask for any needed help and clarification via Slack, text, or phone call if you get stuck. Everyone will help each other out as best as we can via all forms of communication.
Please communicate your needs and grievances with each other as soon as possible through Slack or text.

* How will development tasks be chosen/assigned/accepted?
> Tasks will be evenly divided and assigned during check-in, and will be based on each team members' strengths and availability. At the end of check-in we will review the assigned tasks and make sure that everyone knows what they need to get done for the night. 

* What practices do intend to use for resolution of conflicts?
> First, we will sit-down and have a short meeting to communicate what the conflict is. Then we will work to resolve the issue quickly as a team. More specifically, if conflicts continue then they will be resolved democratically via a required majority 2/3 (two-thirds) vote to proceed.

* Management of Branches and Merging
> We will manage all of our project branches by working on our own individual branches for different features that we will be working on. From there, we will get together before merging  to the master and confirm that the branch we will be merging from is working properly.

* Daily Scrum
> We will hold a 5-minute daily scrum at the end of class. So from 5:00 P.M. to 5:15P.M. everyday we have class.
>During the scrum we will update each other on our progress, what we're working on, and what we're struggling with.
