## Project Description
Have you ever gone on a trip, or to a party with friends, but forgot to take photos? Or did you forget ask your friends to send you photos from the event? 
Or have you ever come
home from an event with mostly photos of your friends or acquaintances, but with only a few grainy, questionable selfies of yourself? Are you tired of taking great photos of others, but not having any of your own to show off? Well fear no more, PicMe Gallery is the app for you.

PicMe Gallery, is an app that allows users who are out at an event, or who are traveling together to get access to a secure, cloud-based photo gallery via a shared password.

With PicMe Gallery in your pocket, you'll no longer have to beg your friends and family to share those photos with you, only to have
them send some mediocre ones where they look good, but you're blinking or looking slightly less-than-stellar.

PicMe Gallery's goal is to 
help family and friends seamlessly exchange photos they have of each other through a private-shared gallery that automatically populates from users' phones once an event is underway. Just join the event by entering the event name and password, set your phone to event mode (auto-uploading), and enjoy access to the event gallery for up to three days after the event. After that your photos are deleted from the online gallery, and you get to keep the ones you've downloaded.

No need to mess with iMessage, Messenger, WhatsApp, Facebook, or Google Photos. If you have access to the password for the event, just sign in, select your photos, download, and be on your way.

#### Key Functionality

* Automatic uploading of user photos to event gallery, once they're signed in with the event password.
* Camera-integration for ease of photo taking and sharing.
* Android gallery-style selection for intuitive downloading of shared photos.
* Photo captions, metadata, and the username of whomever uploaded the photo, will be available for event documentation and recollection purposes.
* Secure events-based gallery
* Auto-deletion of event info (including user and photo data) after three days for users' security
